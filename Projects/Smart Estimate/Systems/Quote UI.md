- [ ] Accept a string as an initial value as well as options of type DmnSelectOption



##### DmnSelectOption
- Value: string
	- All values in html should boil down to strings. Not sure if I can use other types but for now this works as all I want is a UID from the selection as the value.
- Label: string
	- What shows up in the rendered list.
- Group: string?
	- Optional tag for sorting options into groups
- Group2: string?
	- Another tag for one more level of group
