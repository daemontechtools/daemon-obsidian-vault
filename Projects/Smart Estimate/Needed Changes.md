- Need to include `AddressNotes` in Add ShipLocation.
- Going to need
	- `ShipLocation.DefaultContact.DisplayName`
	- `ShipLocation.DefaultContact.DefaultEmail`
	- `ShipLocation.DefaultContact.DefaultPhone
- Both `DefaultPhone` and `DefaultEmail` are `CommunicationLink`s
	- What is a `CommunicationLink`?
	- How can I create and read them as strings?
- I need the ability mutate a `ShipLocation` if someone needs to make a change or fix a mistake
