##### Dynamically render absolute child element on top of it's parent

^f668cd

If you want to dynamically render a child element based on the `click` or `focus` events of the parent, keep in mind that the child will not be there to receive click events when it is clicked because you'll have fired the `onblur` event of the parent and removing the element from the DOM before it's able to receive an `click` events.
