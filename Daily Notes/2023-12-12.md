### Issues Collecting From Client

Having issues collecting on 59 hours worked and the client is asking me to make more changes, for free.
#### Arguments

- They agreed to let me work FULL TIME until I was able to push to prod. They claimed not to remember saying that but for nearly 2 months I was working, attending every daily scrum, supporting the team.
 - Do they or do they not agree with me that those changes were necessary for the app to continue working.
 - At what point did my hours transition into "unpaid hours"?

#### Other Notes
Obsidian is very cool but their hosting options are ridiculous.
