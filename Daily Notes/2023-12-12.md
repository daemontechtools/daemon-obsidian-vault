JN asked me to push the changes I did to staging. Don't understand how he can deny me 59 hours of work and still ask me for help.

- You agreed to let me work FULL TIME until I was able to push to prod. You claimed not to remember saying that but for nearly 2 months I was working, attending every daily scrum, supporting the team and you allowed me to do this.
  
	
 
 - Do you or do you not agree with me that those changes were necessary for the app to continue working.
	- At what point did my hours transition into "unpaid hours"?


Obsidian is very cool but their hosting options are ridiculous.
