  I absolutely love your tech stack and it's very close to an infrastructure that I would use in my own personal projects. I've been in Web Development for 12 years as a Fullstack developer but I'm very passionate about transitioning to a Backend specialization. I love programming in Go, I have over decade of hands on experience with AWS and have a strong grasp of cloud infrastructure.
