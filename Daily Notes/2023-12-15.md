## Tasks
- [x] Meeting with Mathieu at 11:00am
	- Want to discuss the lack of documentation and what I can do to improve.
	- Address lack of focus on my part lately. Allowing myself to get distracted by other clients.
	- Underestimated the complexity of this project and thought I could get away with less documentation. Mistake.
	- Set a new expectation for EOW next week. Need to seriously grind to get this out but biggest blockers are out of the way.
- [ ] Really need to get this DONE!
	- [ ] Finish Add New Project View
	- [ ] Start on Add Room
	- [ ] Get an idea on Add Product also

## Notes
- Haircut from 9 - 10am
- Might be able to get some advice on Project Management Processes for the future from Mathieu
- Maybe I should make a template for my daily Notes so I don't need to keep copy/pasting them
- I'd like to automate the deployment of these docs. Like every 30 mins or something only if there is a change?
