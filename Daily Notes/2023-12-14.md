## Tasks
- [ ] Should connect with Mathieu before the end of day
- [ ] Finish Add New Project View
- [ ] Start on Add Room
- [ ] Get an idea on Add Product also

## Notes
-  I really need to commit to git more often. I can go days without committing anything because it's in a broken state. That's what a feature branch is for though...Unstable changes?
